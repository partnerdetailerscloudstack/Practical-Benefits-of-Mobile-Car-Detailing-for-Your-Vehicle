                <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
                <p>
                    Keeping your car clean isn’t just about appearances. Dirt, grime, and environmental pollutants can cause long-term damage to your paint, wheels, interior materials, and more. Regular detailing extends the life of your vehicle, helps maintain its resale value, and makes every drive more enjoyable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With mobile detailing, the benefits go a step further. You don’t need to adjust your day or carve out time to visit a shop. We come to your driveway, office parking lot, or wherever your vehicle is. You get the same professional care, but on your terms.
                </p>
                <h2>What We Bring to Every Mobile Detailing Appointment</h2>

                <p>

                <h2>Common Questions About Mobile Car Detailing</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Is mobile car detailing safe for my paint?</b> <br>Absolutely. We use safe, tested products that protect your paint rather than damage it. Our wash techniques avoid swirl marks and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/micro-scratches"><b>micro-scratches</b></a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>How long does a typical detail take?</b> <br>It depends on the size and condition of the vehicle, but most services take between 1.5 to 3 hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Do I need to be present during the service?</b> <br>Not necessarily. As long as we have access to the vehicle and know your expectations ahead of time, we can take care of the work while you’re at home, in a meeting, or even running errands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Can you detail in an apartment complex or parking garage?</b> <br>In many cases, yes. We just need enough space to work safely around the vehicle. Let us know your location details when booking and we’ll let you know if we can accommodate it.
